# Compound Lottie ImageView

This is a simple compound view that can either show an image or an animation using the Lottie framework. This can be used in places where you want to be able to dynamically show one of the two options as well as giving you the option to load images easily from the web using Fresco.

## Usage

Include the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation "app.appsoluut:cliview:1.0.0"
}
```

You can create the view in the layout as normal; for example:

```xml
<app.appsoluut.android.cliv.CLIView
    android:id="@+id/cli_view"
    android:layout_width="128dp"
    android:layout_height="48dp" />
```
